        <p class="overview-subtitle">Cornell University has three different space reservation systems that allow users to reserve various spaces and rooms in Ithaca campus. Reserving process should be concise and fast, not overwhelming. Users reserve and wait for reservation confirmation without any confidence. CURE (Cornell University Reservation Express) consolidates three existing systems and simplifies the reservation process for more delightful reservation experience. </p>

        <p class="body-contents">As an active member of various clubs in Cornell, I want to reserve a space for club activities, but I cannot because current room reservation solutions are difficult to use; instructions and policies are hard to find; and confirmation for the space requests takes too long.</p>

        <p class="body-small-title">OVERVIEW & USER RESEARCH</p>
        <p class="body-contents body-title">Current systems handle a lot of reservable spaces, but uncertainty of responses for request and scattered instructions make users hard to reserve. </p>
        <p class="body-contents">Three existing systems, R25, Libcal, and Cornell Spaces use different methods of reservation: submit forms, make phone calls, send emails, and attend board committee meeting. These solutions feel overwhelming and frustrating:</p>
        <p class="tab  body-quote">"Reservation confirmation depends on how busy the staff is" , "Multiple rounds of Google search to find instructions are uncomfortable", "I once never received email back from the staff, so I had to send reminder email." and "I had to submit multiple forms and emails again because the space was not available for that time." </p>
        <p class="body-contents"> There is no confidence that a space is available, no guideline what to include for reservation requests, and emails are hard to track. A <strong>streamlined reservation system</strong> with <strong>communication channel</strong> will provide users more defined reservation process and understanding of status of their requests. </p>
    
        <div class="column">
            <p>Facilitate Reservation Process</p>
            <p>To ease the reservation process, users must be able to check space availabilities prior to reservation request and provide all necessary information for reservation at once to organized standard system. With clear space availabilities and form asking required information in one consolidated system, reservation experience will be much more efficient. </p>

        <div class="column"> 
            <p>Communication Channel </p>
            <p>Users must be able to easily track status of reservation and have a unique space for  communication with responsible staff members. </p>
